            <p>
              There's nothing like the views you get when hiking in the
              Mountains! And I wasn't even prepared for what happened whilst I
              was enjoying the view!

  <h2> What I Do </h2>
  <p>I love programming, I love to help others and I enjoy exploring new technologies!</p>
  <p>
   My goal is to keep on growing as a developer - and if I could help you do the same, I'd be very happy!
